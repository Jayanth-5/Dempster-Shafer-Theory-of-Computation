# Dempster-Shafer-Theory-of-Computation

Hey there! This project brings the Dempster-Shafer Theory to life using Python. It’s a cool way to handle uncertainty, and I’ve put together some code to make it easy to play with.

So, what’s this theory all about? Imagine you’re trying to solve a mystery with incomplete clues. The Dempster-Shafer Theory lets you weigh different possibilities—like “maybe it’s this, or maybe it’s that”—and combine evidence to get closer to the truth. It’s more flexible than regular probability and perfect for when things aren’t black-and-white.

## What’s Inside
- `dempster_shafer.py`: The heart of the project—think of it as the engine that powers the MassFunction class.
- `examples.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook where you can see the theory in action with some fun examples.
